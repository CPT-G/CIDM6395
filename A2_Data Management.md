### <h2 id="Introduction">**Introduction**</h2>

The Capstone project for the [Master's of Science in Computer Information Systems and Business Analytics](https://www.wtamu.edu/academics/college-business/academics/graduate-programs/programs/mscisba-program.html) at [West Texas A&M University](https://www.wtamu.edu/) synthesizes the key curricular areas including Data Analytics, Data Management, Software Systems, and Networking and Cybersecurity. This assessment evaluates my competency in Data Management, detailing my strengths, weaknesses, and areas for improvement as I approach completion of the [Computer Information and Decision Management (CIDM)](https://www.wtamu.edu/academics/college-business/about-us/cidm-department/index.html) coursework.

## <h2 id="Professors-Intent">**Professor's Intent**</h2>

The professors' intent for the data management courses was to provide a comprehensive and practical understanding of data management concepts, tools, and techniques. CIDM 6351 focused on the extraction and transformation of data from external sources, emphasizing data cleaning, normalization, and preparation for federated data persistence platforms. This course aimed to equip students with skills in ETL processes, data warehousing concepts, and data querying techniques. CIDM 6355 aimed to provide a broad introduction to data mining, covering concepts, algorithms, theories, and processes, with a focus on practical application of tools like RapidMiner and R. These courses were designed to develop students' data analytical thinking, problem-solving skills, and the ability to apply data management and mining techniques to various business contexts. The professors also emphasized the importance of communicating data mining results effectively and encouraged further learning through external resources like DataCamp, ensuring students are well-prepared for their careers in data management and analytics.

### <h3 id="What-I-Know">**What I Know**</h3>

My journey through the Data Management curriculum has provided me with a robust foundation in a variety of tools and techniques. I have become proficient in using [Python](https://www.python.org/) for data extraction, transformation, and load (ETL) with [Pandas](https://pandas.pydata.org/), data visualization with [Matplotlib](https://matplotlib.org/), and numerical computations with [NumPy](https://numpy.org/). My SQL skills encompass writing complex queries, optimizing database performance, and understanding schema design—crucial components for effective data management. I can create databases, tables, fields, primary keys, foreign keys, and relationships, and insert data into tables.

I have strong understanding of ETL processes, data warehousing concepts, data lakes, data marts, and data pipelines. I can query data warehouses using cube, rollup, slice, and materialized views. I am skilled in collecting, extracting, cleaning, and preparing raw data for analysis, including web scraping. I am also proficient in data analysis process.

In addition to programming capabilities, I have gained expertise in data warehouse concepts, applying them to guide data management projects. My experience with Excel includes advanced data analysis, pivot tables, complex functions, and data visualization. I am adept at creating interactive dashboards in [Power BI](https://powerbi.microsoft.com/) and [Tableau](https://www.tableau.com/), enhancing my ability to present data insights effectively.

Furthermore, I am familiar with data preparation processes, decision trees, naive bayes classification, clustering algorithms, and neural network models. I have used RapidMiner and R to perform various data mining tasks on large datasets and apply data mining techniques to various business contexts.
