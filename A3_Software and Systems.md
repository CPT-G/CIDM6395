## <h2 id="Introduction">**Introduction**</h2>

The Capstone project for the [Master's of Science in Computer Information Systems and Business Analytics](https://www.wtamu.edu/academics/college-business/academics/graduate-programs/programs/mscisba-program.html) at [West Texas A&M University](https://www.wtamu.edu/) synthesizes the key curricular areas including Data Analytics, Data Management, Software Systems, and Networking and Cybersecurity. This assessment evaluates my competency in Software and Systems, detailing my strengths, weaknesses, and areas for improvement as I approach completion of the [Computer Information and Decision Management (CIDM)](https://www.wtamu.edu/academics/college-business/about-us/cidm-department/index.html) coursework.

## <h2 id="Professors-Intent">**Professor's Intent**</h2>

The professors' intent for the software and systems courses was to provide a comprehensive and practical understanding of software development, web technologies, and ethical considerations. CIDM 6303 focused on foundational topics in structured and procedural programming, database management, and software/web development, including procedural programming, object-oriented programming, data access, HTML/CSS, SQL, data normalization, entity relational diagrams, and object modeling. CIDM 6330 aimed to provide a capstone experience in software engineering and systems development, emphasizing requirement specifications, logical design, issues in OOP, design patterns, client-server computing, and project management. These courses were designed to equip students with the necessary skills to develop web-based applications, understand ethical implications in technology, and align software projects with organizational objectives. The professors also provided advanced materials and encouraged further learning through practical application, ensuring students are well-prepared for their careers in software and systems development.
