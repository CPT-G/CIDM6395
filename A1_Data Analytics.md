## <h2 id="Introduction">**Introduction**</h2>

The Capstone project for the [Master's of Science in Computer Information Systems and Business Analytics](https://www.wtamu.edu/academics/college-business/academics/graduate-programs/programs/mscisba-program.html) at [West Texas A&M University](https://www.wtamu.edu/) synthesizes the key curricular areas including Data Analytics, Data Management, Software Systems, and Networking and Cybersecurity. The program promotes leadership, communication, critical thinking, business integration, core business knowledge, a global perspective, and business ethics and governance, all interwoven throughout the curriculum to enhance professional growth and advancement. This assessment evaluates my competency in Data Analytics, detailing my strengths, weaknesses, and areas for improvement as I approach completion of the [Computer Information and Decision Management (CIDM)](https://www.wtamu.edu/academics/college-business/about-us/cidm-department/index.html) coursework.

## <h2 id="Professors-Intent">**Professor's Intent**</h2>

The professors' intent for the data analytics courses was to provide a comprehensive and practical understanding of data analytics concepts, tools, and techniques. CIDM 5310 focused on the applied and theoretical understanding of software architecture, emphasizing Power BI and Azure for data modeling, forecasting, and visualization. CIDM 6308 aimed to provide a broad introduction to data analytics, covering database management, data preparation, business intelligence, and machine learning, with a focus on practical application of statistical tools in business. These courses were designed to equip students with the necessary skills to develop data-analytic thinking, use popular DA tools, and apply statistical techniques like regression, classification, and clustering to solve business problems. The professors also provided advanced materials and encouraged further learning through external resources, ensuring students are well-prepared for their careers in analytics.

### <h3 id="What-I-Know">**What I Know**</h3>

My journey through the Data Analytics curriculum has provided me with a robust foundation in a variety of tools and techniques. I have become proficient in using Python for data manipulation with [Pandas](https://pandas.pydata.org/docs/), data visualization with [Matplotlib](https://matplotlib.org/), and numerical computations with [NumPy](https://numpy.org/doc/stable/). For example, in the CIDM 5310 course, I used Pandas to clean and transform a large dataset of customer transactions, preparing it for analysis in Power BI. My SQL skills encompass writing complex queries, optimizing database performance, and understanding schema designâ€”crucial components for effective data management. In a project for CIDM 6308, I wrote complex SQL queries to extract and aggregate data from multiple tables, generating insights into sales trends.

In addition to programming capabilities, I have gained expertise in business intelligence concepts, applying them to guide analytics projects. My experience with Excel includes advanced data analysis, pivot tables, complex functions, and data visualization. I am adept at creating interactive dashboards in [Tableau](https://www.tableau.com/) and [Power BI](https://powerbi.microsoft.com/), enhancing my ability to present data insights effectively. I created a Power BI dashboard in CIDM 5310 that visualized key performance indicators for a retail company, allowing stakeholders to easily track sales and inventory levels. My understanding of ETL processes is comprehensive, with strong command over table transformation, normalization, and ensuring data integrity. I have integrated database systems with Python for advanced data analysis and manipulation, possessing solid knowledge of data storage, queries, and database modeling techniques. Furthermore, I am familiar with data preparation processes, classification algorithms (decision trees, logistic regression), clustering algorithms, and text mining techniques, which are essential for comprehensive data analysis. I have used RapidMiner to implement various machine learning models.

### <h3 id="Where-I-Am-Weak">**Where I Am Weak**</h3>

Despite my strengths, there are several areas I need to improve. Advanced programming paradigms, such as [Object-Oriented](https://realpython.com/python3-object-oriented-programming/) and [Functional Programming](https://realpython.com/lessons/functional-programming-python/) with Python, are topics I need to explore further. I have struggled with implementing complex inheritance structures in Python projects. Tackling more complex SQL scenarios, such as nested queries and advanced join operations, remains a challenge. For example, I found it difficult to write a nested query that involved multiple subqueries and conditional aggregation.

In Excel, I need to delve into advanced features like [Power Query](https://support.microsoft.com/en-us/excel) and [VBA](https://docs.microsoft.com/en-us/office/vba/api/overview/excel) for automation. Additionally, I aim to enhance my knowledge of advanced DAX functions and Power Query in [Power BI](https://powerbi.microsoft.com/). I have had trouble with the Time Intelligence DAX functions, and creating measures that dynamically change based on user input. Proficiency in using [RapidMiner](https://rapidminer.com/) for data mining and machine learning tasks, including understanding its various operators and workflows, is another area I need to develop. I have yet to fully master the process of creating and deploying complex machine learning models within RapidMiner, and optimizing their performance.

While my understanding of ETL processes is strong, I seek more hands-on experience in designing and implementing database solutions for real-world scenarios, including those that include cloud based solutions. Exploring advanced data modeling techniques and optimizing SQL queries are also priorities for improvement. Moreover, gaining practical experience in database administration and implementation, understanding advanced normalization techniques, and developing proficiency in [R](https://cran.r-project.org/) for data analysis, statistical modeling, and visualization are crucial steps in my growth.
